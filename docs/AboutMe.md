My name is Seth Medina and I've been a big fan of computers and technology since the 1st grade when my mom brought home a shiny new desktop computer. While she was using it to peruse the (new-to-the-world) Internet for new houses, I was just excited to try out all of the video games that were being planted in the boxes of my favorite breakfast cereals (anyone remember Chex Quest?). My love for computers and tech has only grown over the course of my life.

I currently work as an IT Business Analyst and Technical Writer for a division of Nelnet, the consumer loan finance company that might service your student loans (and mine). In this role, I am responsible for maintaining, updating, and advocating for the large internal knowledge base of technical information that is used by our cross-functional teams of developers, business analysts, and product managers. During our two-week sprints, I track the work being done by three teams responsible for different areas of the product and work to incorporate any major changes in system functionality into the various areas of documentation that I am responsible for. 

These areas include:

* a Confluence knowledge base
* an API reference website (maintained using a docs-as-code approach)
* three separate user guides for the different user portals

My background is a unique blend of various writing positions and roles in the world of Information Technology. In my early roles in IT, I worked in very hands-on environments, installing and configuring software across client computing environments and helping fix things when they went wrong. These were primarily software that used SQL database engines, so I became very familiar with databases and their tooling. Prior to my endeavors in IT, I worked as a writer for various companies in the social media and search engine spaces. These roles helped shape my ability to write for different audiences and understand how to get in the shoes of the reader.

In most places I've worked, documentation was an afterthought, meaning I've had the opportunity to help build team processes and best practices for efficiently completing the various tasks associated with documentation. This also means that I've continuously advocated for our users and internal stakeholders who would benefit greatly from having quality documentation at their fingertips.

Technical writing has become a true passion of mine. This is largely because:

* I love learning about complex topics and ideas.
* I love helping others accomplish their goals and projects.
* I love the technology and tooling involved with modern technical writing workflows.
* I love organizing information and designing documents.
* I love words and language.

### Personal details

* I currently work remotely in New Mexico with my fiance who works at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
* We have a 3-year-old Goldendoodle named Maisie who we love quite a bit.
* I love outdoor recreation and am very active.
    * I completed a 400-mile bikepacking loop around Scotland in September of 2023 with a group of friends.
    * I completed a 50-mile backpacking trip along the Bechler River in Yellowstone National Park in 2021.
    * I grew up snowboarding, but taught myself to ski while working at the resort.
    * I played roller and ice hockey throughout high school and college and my favorite NHL team is the Avalanche!

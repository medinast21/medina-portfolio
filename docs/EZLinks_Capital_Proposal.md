# Proposal

## Capital Expense Project Proposal

This short document was created as part of a proposal from the Information Systems department to move away from one software and replace it with another. It covers the overall cost estimates, pros and cons for the project, current pain points, and a narrative explaining the objectives and reasoning for the proposed solution.

#### Current RTP Retail deficiencies:
* Scan guns are reaching life expectancy
* RTP scan guns experience more problems than those used with IBS / EZLinks
* Active Network support not as strong as EZLinks support
* Unable to view retail variance in real-time
* Poor membership experience; EZLinks is our preferred membership software
* Must manually input member billing account charges from RTP to EZLinks
#### Benefits of moving to EZLinks for Retail:
* Less problematic scan guns
* EZLinks is used by our summer retail operations and our membership team
* Members will be able to view purchases / receipts online
* More user friendly for staff
#### Cons of moving to EZLinks for Retail:
* We lose resort charge functionality at retail locations

### Proposed solution
Retail operations at Telluride Ski and Golf are currently split between two different software:
RTP and IBS. While our Golf Pro Shop uses IBS in the summer months, the bulk of our retail
operations, including The Resort Store, Heritage and Telluride Naturals, all operate using RTP.
RTP excels in certain environments, such as the Pass Office, Skier Visit Reporting, and F&B, but seems to fall short when it comes to retail and inventory, comparatively.

The current model of scan gun that we must use (due to compatibility reasons) for RTP retail
operations are approaching five years of use, and we are experiencing more and more
problems with them as the days pass. Because the support warranties for the guns are about to
expire, we think it is time to decide on a new direction for retail.

There are pros and cons to switching over to IBS, but in our opinion, the pros far
outweigh the cons. 

To start, the MC2100 model of scan gun that the Golf Pro Shop uses in
conjunction with IBS has seen fewer problems over the years when compared to RTP and the
MC3200 model of scan gun, and IBS / EZLinks support has demonstrated a much better effort
to help support our retail operations.

Additionally, we will be able to see retail variance in real time (instead of having to wait for
inventory batches to upload overnight), and IBS is our main software for managing club
memberships, which means members will be able to view receipts for any purchases made
when paying their membership bill online. Other benefits include not needing to manually input
billing account charges from RTP into IBS (which saves money on labor), as well as some of our
RTP software licenses getting freed up, allowing us to use them elsewhere (such as Gorrono)
when/if we need them.

The cons of switching to IBS include losing features such as Resort Charge and any
RTP-integrated gift cards, as well as having to train staff on IBS / EZLinks software. Any RTP
gift cards that are in circulation now will not function at IBS / EZlinks retail locations. We could
implement a work-around, but feel that it would cause more problems than if we were to not do
it.

We believe that it is time to move away from RTP as our main retail software, and subsequently,
move away from these specific scan guns as well. Utilizing IBS / EZLinks software for our retail
operations will save time and money, provide a better experience for our retail staff and will
ultimately provide a better overall experience for our members.

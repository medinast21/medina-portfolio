## “Unimaginable” Radiation Levels Discovered at Fukushima Nuclear Reactor (2017)

The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station is back in the media spotlight amidst concerns
that radiation levels are becoming incredibly unstable and potentially dangerous should they not
decrease relatively soon.

Radiation levels are suspected to be at their highest since the Fukushima nuclear station
became damaged by an earthquake and the ensuing tsunami just six years ago; a catastrophe
that caused a triple meltdown.

The Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) believed radiation levels to be about 530 sieverts
per hour in the containment vessel of reactor number two, but after the failure of a
remote-controlled cleaning robot, designed to withstand up to 1,000 sieverts of radiation
exposure, TEPCO now believes radiation levels to be much higher than initially thought.

To get an idea of just how dangerous this situation could be, one sievert is enough radiation to
induce nausea and radiation sickness in a human being. Five sieverts would kill about half of
the people exposed to it over the course of a month. And ten sieverts would kill most humans
within a few weeks. 530 sieverts would be enough to kill a human being almost instantly.

After using image analysis of the reactor’s pressure vessel, it was discovered that a one-meter
wide hole is now present in the metal grating located beneath the pressure vessel. Officials
believe it is likely to have been caused by melted nuclear fuel after the tsunami from the
previous earthquake took Fukushima Daiichi’s back-up cooling system offline.

While this is undoubtedly scary, TEPCO maintains that there have been zero leaks in the
reactor and outside levels of radiation have not increased.

All efforts to assess just how damaged the reactor has become have failed, as the
specially-designed robots TEPCO was hoping to use in the waters beneath the power plant
have all been rendered useless after being exposed to the high levels of radiation.

The Fukushima power plant disaster is the largest since Chernobyl in 1986, and the
decommissioning of the plant is expected to take tens of years to complete.

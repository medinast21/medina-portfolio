## Installing and Configuring the Act! Web API Database Connection

### Overview
The Act! CRM web API tool provides a connection from an Act! database to various other pieces of software. These can
include other modules within the Act! software (ie. Act! Marketing Automation) or 3rd-party connections (such as
Zapier, etc.).

Deploying the Act! web API endpoint happens in one of two ways:
1) Installing the Act! Connect Link software
2) Installing an SSL certificate for use with Act! Premium for Web
This document helps the Act! consultant understand how to achieve both of these configurations.
